// distinct state from "scored zero" or "forfeited by timeout," not something
// encoded into a free-form `reason` string alongside a fake `score: 0`. Three
// states:
//  - "completed": a real score was submitted and replayed (verdict: valid or
//    invalid — see ScoreVerdict below; even an invalid score is still a
//    completed submission, just a rejected one).
//  - "forfeited": never submitted anything, by choice or timeout (idle,
//    tabbed away, deliberately withholding, or the FORFEIT_GRACE_MS window
//    expired). See PROGRESS.md's forfeit-timeout section for why this is a
//    loss for them (the submitter wins) rather than voiding the match.
//  - "opponent_disconnected": this player's own run was still in progress —
//    never submitted, never had the chance to — when their opponent left.
//    Not their fault, not a forfeit; the match resolved because of the OTHER
//    side's action, not this side's inaction. See packages/server/src/
